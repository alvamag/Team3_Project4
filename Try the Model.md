# Try the Model

*The **Try the Model** page allows users to input physicochemical properties of a wine sample and predict its quality using our trained **Random Forest Classifier**.
This section is interactive and built to showcase the power of machine learning applied to wine chemistry!*
---
## How It Works 
- Users input **11 chemical properties** of a wine sample (e.g., acidity, alcohol, pH)
- They select whether the wine is **red** or **white**
- A trained Random Forest model processes the input and predicts the wine's **quality label**:
  - `Low` (score 3–5)
  - `Medium` (score 6)
  - `High` (score 7–10)

#### Tech Stack
- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- **Backend**: Flask (Python)
- **Model**: Random Forest Classifier (`joblib`-loaded `.pkl`)
- **Data**: Cleaned dataset from Portuguese red & white wines

#### Prediction Output
Once submitted, the model returns:
- **Label**: `Low`, `Medium`, or `High`
- **Class**: Corresponding numeric class (e.g., `0`, `1`, or `2`)

## Deployment Instructions
This app is deployed using **Render**, which hosts both the backend Flask application and the frontend interface. Follow the steps below to deploy the full `wine_quality_app` directory.
### Project Structure
```

└── wine_quality_app/
    ├── app.py                  # Main Flask app
    ├── requirements.txt        # Python dependencies
    ├── Procfile                # Tells Render how to start the app
    ├── render.yaml             # (Optional) Auto-deploy config for Render

### How to Deploy on Render
1. **Push the project to a GitHub repository** if it isn’t already.
2. **Create a Web Service** on [Render](https://render.com):
   - Select your GitHub repo.
   - Choose the `main` branch.
   - Set your environment to **Python 3**.
   - Configure the following:
     **Build Command:**
     ```
     cd wine_quality_app && pip install -r requirements.txt
     ```
     **Start Command:**
     ```
     cd wine_quality_app && gunicorn app:app
     ```
3. **(Optional)** — To automate the build setup, include this `render.yaml` in the root of your repo:
```yaml
services:
  - type: web
    name: wine-quality-app
    env: python
    buildCommand: cd wine_quality_app && pip install -r requirements.txt
    startCommand: cd wine_quality_app && gunicorn app:app
    region: oregon
    plan: free
    autoDeploy: true
```
> :repeat: Once configured, Render will automatically redeploy every time you push to the `main` branch.

### Accessing the Live Site
Once deployed, your app will be available at a link like:
```
https://wine-quality-app.onrender.com
```
> Use the live site to test the prediction model, explore interactive visualizations, and view the full project experience.

## GeoJSON Mapping with OpenStreetMap
To visualize winery locations across Portugal, we integrated **GeoJSON data** retrieved from [OpenStreetMap](https://www.openstreetmap.org/) using [Overpass Turbo](https://overpass-turbo.eu/). This allowed us to filter all locations tagged with `craft=winery` within the boundaries of Portugal.
The resulting dataset was exported as a structured `.geojson` file (`portugal_wineries.geojson`) containing:
- Winery names
- Coordinates
- Optional metadata (address, notes, etc.)
We used [Folium](https://python-visualization.github.io/folium/) — a Python mapping library built on top of Leaflet.js — to generate an interactive map directly in Python. Each winery was represented with a **:wine_glass: wine glass emoji marker** and included a popup displaying the winery's name and region (when available).
To embed the map into our site without breaking existing styles, we used Folium’s `_repr_html_()` method to render it as an inline HTML snippet. This map was then inserted into a styled card component within our Flask template to visually match the rest of the site.
> The final result: a dynamic, interactive map of Portuguese wineries that blends seamlessly into our front end — and invites users to explore wine country, one click at a time.
